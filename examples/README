This directory contains several examples of transformation and tool behaviours.

These examples are also used to test PyForTool.

There are several kinds of tests/examples:

  - those with foo_before.F90 and foo_after.F90 files
    In this case, the transformation of the "before" file must
    produce the "after" file without error
  - those with foo_checkOK.F90 files
    In this case, the transformation of the file must
    execute without error
  - those with foo_checkKO.F90
    At the contrary, these transformations must produce an error

For each file to process, a comment line begining with "!#PYFT transfo: "
contains the transformations to apply to the file.

The tests.sh script executes all the transformations and produce a report
in case some tests failed or crashed.
